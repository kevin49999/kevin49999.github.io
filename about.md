title: About
---

I grew up in Austin, TX and studied Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. After graduating I briefly worked in advertising while programming on the side. I've been living in New York City since 2016 working as a mobile software developer. I worked at an [agency](https://www.majestykapps.com/), and more recently worked at a [startup](https://mealpal.com/).

I'm interested in learning more about programming, understanding how computers work at a low level, and becoming more of a generalist. I like to go to the movies, run, read, and explore the city. I'm a fan of sustainability and can't wait to see it applied in real ways by everyone.
