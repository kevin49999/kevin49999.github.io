title: About
---

I grew up in Austin, TX and studied Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. After graduating I briefly worked in online advertising while programming on the side. I've been living in New York City for the past 4 years working as a mobile software developer. I worked at an [agency](https://www.majestykapps.com/), and more recently worked at a [startup](https://mealpal.com/).

I'm interested in product design and find inspiration outside of technology in movies, fashion, painting, etc. I'm also serious about programming, understanding how computers work on a fundamental level, and being less of a specialist and more of a generalist. One idea I care about is sustainability and how it can be practiced across different industries in real ways.
