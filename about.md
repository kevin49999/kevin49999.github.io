title: About
---

I grew up in Austin, TX and studied Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. After graduating I briefly worked in advertising while programming on the side. I've been living in New York since 2016 working as a software engineer. I've worked at an [agency](https://www.majestykapps.com/), [startup](https://mealpal.com/), and am currently working at another [startup](https://policygenius.com).

I like to go to the movies, run, read, and explore the city. I'm interested in sustainability, nuclear energy, and saving the environment.

If you would like to contact me, my email is at the bottom of the page.
