I grew up in Austin, TX and studied Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. After graduating I briefly worked in advertising while programming on the side.

I've been living in New York since 2016 working as a software engineer. I've worked at an [agency](https://www.majestykapps.com/), [startup](https://mealpal.com/), and am currently working at another [startup](https://policygenius.com).

If you would like to contact me, my email is at the bottom of the page.
