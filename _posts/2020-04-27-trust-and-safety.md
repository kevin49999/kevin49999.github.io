title: Marketplace Trust and Safety
---


Trust and safety is the most important aspect of any marketplace with the the least amount of innovation.

If we look at eBay, the classic online marketplace, what monumental (like what [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) has done for encryption) inventions have arisen that could be applied to each transaction to ensure the person on each side gets exactly what they want. Each buyer gets the item they expect, each seller gets the money they expect. 

Looking at eBay and other peer to peer marketplaces, they give you an approximation for the experience you'll have by having users leave feedback. This is generally reliable because honest people continue to act honestly and a smaller percentage of dishonest people are filtered out and banned after displaying their bad behavior. You're problem is now keeping old/new bad actors out, while validating old/new good actors and adding digital gold stars to their reputations for people to rely on.

### Three Sided Marketplaces

We don't always think about it, but most transactions we enter into we feel safe about because of a middleman that's assumed to be trustworthy that sits between the two parties. If we take a simplified example of physically depositing money at the bank, why do we feel safe doing that? Why do we trust that the teller is going to put that money into our account and not drop it in their wallet? Because we're trusting that the bank has systems to keep their workers honest, and even if the teller did steal the money, we would require the bank to reimburse us. We require the bank to take on the risk of handling deposits and everything after that.

A peer-to-peer marketplace has a completely different feeling because __we__ are the ones taking on the risk. If I purchase a painting, I need to know I'm going to get that exact painting in a reasonable amount of time. Internet marketplaces like StockX, Goat, etc. that address the clothing market try to take that risky feeling out by acting as a middleman. Adding a middleman to a transaction is not a fullproof solution though! You're taking the trust that buyers/sellers were placing in each other and dumping into another source - but that source still may not to be trustworthy! There are terrible examples where just as much if not more damage was done to the users of a marketplace after the middleman fell apart - [Mt Gox](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mt-gox.asp). One might even be able to compare the experience of a dealing with a bad middleman to going to a bad restaurant (questionable analogy - this is more like 2sided). You go in, everything looks and feels like a good restaurant, you know more or less what you're going to receive (but it's not guaranteed), and then you end up with bad service and a terrible meal - something you wouldn't have agree to pay for or lose money to. Even sometimes when we go to a restaurant we love we can have a bad experience that we wouldn't have agree to pay for! This is no different than the eBay seller with 1000+ good reviews who provides the odd bad transaction (item not in condition they said, forgets to ship, goes on vacation without updating store). Each time you have that bad experience you're dealing with the negative side of human behavior that has room to breathe because fo the way these systems are currently designed.

What if there were a way to design transactions in a way that they could only be completed when each side is in agreement? Where even when dealing with a dishonest person, their only option other than no action is to act honestly?

### RSA

When describing RSA encryption in [The Code Book](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography-ebook/dp/B004IK8PLE) the author takes the problem that the individuals solved and states it with a simple metaphor (that I will butcher - go read this book if you haven't I can't recommend it enough). He says something along the lines of, would it be possible to design a box, that anyone could lock, but only the owner of the box can unlock.

GO GET THE BOOK!

Simply stated, can we design a perfect marketplace transaction where a seller only option each time is to send exactly what the buyer will accept, and a seller will get the exact money 

### Imaginary Perfect Scenario

Two people meet in the desert (think Casino - add image), one buyer and one seller. The seller places a Louis Vuitton bag in a glass case that automatically shuts.


### Blockchain? (lol)


### Why is the Stock Market Trustworthy? Why is a gold index trustworthy?
