title: Homemade Solar Still (Part 1)
---

![book](/img/homemade_still_1/book_image.jpg)

I first became interested in building a solar still after reading John Perlin's excellent book [Let It Shine: The 6,000-Year Story of Solar Energy](https://www.amazon.com/Let-Shine-000-Year-Story-Energy/dp/1608681327) (the above image can be found on page 45 of this book).

I'm more interested in solar cells/photovoltaics after reading the book, but the solar still seemed like a perfect entry point for building a simple solar tool. It also harkens back to ancient uses for solar energy, in a time when fuel for burning was  expensive. Perlin quotes [Giambattista della Porta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_della_Porta) who said:
"It is good husbandry, to rely on solar energy when ever possible, for the work is done without wood, or coals, or labor". Interestingly enough, della Porta also imagined a gigantic solar mirror for burning enemy ships (people are complicated).

My intended use for the still reflects the use in the picture, to create a perfume (which I will write a part 2 post for). From the same page, Perlin quotes Adam Lonicer who wrote in 1561 how this was done: "Certain types of flowers were submerged in a clear, water-filled vase, which was placed at the focal point of a spherical concave mirror. The concentrated solar heat caused the aromas of the flowers to diffuse into the water, and voilÃ , you had perfume".

### Materials ðŸŒž

* 1 gallon plastic/glass jar. I used this [plastic jar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WWBR13B/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), but if I started today would use this [glass one](https://www.amazon.com/Empty-Gallon-Airtight-Leakproof-Plastic/dp/B075JR6H11/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1548533524&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=1+gallon+glass+jar&psc=1) instead since I'm trying to use less plastic. Both lids are plastic for cutting a circular hole in the top, I'd be interested to see a solution that avoids plastic though ðŸ¤”

* 1 "mash" insulating jar. I used this [growler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GUIMD9Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* 1 glass collector. I used a beer bottle, other small bottles with a cork sized mouth would work too.

* 3/8" copper coil cut into 24" - 32" length. I found this at my local [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3-8-in-OD-x-10-ft-Copper-Soft-Refrigeration-Coil-3-8-R-10RE/203654362?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal2_rr-_-202287075-_-203654362-_-N)

* 3 square foot mirrors. I found mine at a local hardware store

* Wood/cardboard backing for the mirrors + duct tape or other adhesive for mounting

* 2 corks. I used corks from two wine bottles that I had to drill holes through, though the instructable's article mentions finding corks with holes at a wine-brewer hobby shop (could not find one in NYC). I think these could be an equivalent found [online](https://www.widgetco.com/7-cork-stoppers-cork-extra-drilled-hole-3-8-inch), but I did not go that route

### Steps

The guide I followed and will be walking through with my experience, is this great article on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-simple-solar-still/) from several years ago.

The first step I started with was mounting the square foot mirrors on my backing surface. I used the leftover cardboard from an Amazon order and duct tape, but as the other guide mentions a sturdier setup can be achieved with a wood backing. The mirrors are tapped together along their edges, and then tapped to the cardboard. This mirror component's job is concentrating the sunlight onto the insulating jar which contains the mash botte.

The next step I took was cutting a circular hole in the lid of the clear jar for the lid of the inner bottle to come out of. This clear plastic or glass jar acts as a solar heat trap, letting in sunlight and trapping the energy it accumulates like a mini-greenhouse, raising the inside temperature which heats the inner bottle. I cut the hole out using an X-Acto knife which was a little imperfect but worked, there is probably a better way.

Next I took the two used corks from previous wine bottles and proceeded to cut the 3/8" hole through the center. I started by using my electric drill that didn't have a large enough drill bit, but I used to start the hole through the cork. I would then use the copper pipe, twisting it back and forth through the cork, then switching back and forth between drill/pipe until I made it through. If you have a 3/8" drill bit or opted for corks with pre-made holes go ahead and ignore this step - lol.

Here's the copper pipe connected to the collector (where the distilled liquid will end up after the vapor in the tube returns to liquid form). In the instructibles's article the author mentions conditioning the copper piping if you're going to use this to distill something you would be drinking**. This involves running a mixture of white vinegar and water through the pipes to clean them. Also notice how short the length of copper looks, this piece was cut to 16 inches, which is why in the materials section I'm recommending a length fo 24" - 32" as 16" was far too short.

And finally here is the still ready to go out on my fire escape. This picture was taken closer to noon, but at 3PM pointed Southwest it looked like it would be getting plenty of sunlight to do some distilling (I'll see how that goes in the next part).
