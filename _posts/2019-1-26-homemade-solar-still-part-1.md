title: Homemade Solar Still (Part 1)
---

![book](/img/homemade_still_1/book_image.jpg)

I first became interested in building a solar still after reading John Perlin's excellent book [Let It Shine: The 6,000-Year Story of Solar Energy](https://www.amazon.com/Let-Shine-000-Year-Story-Energy/dp/1608681327) (the above image can be found on page 45 of this book).

I'm more interested in solar cells/photovoltaics after reading the book, but the solar still seemed like a perfect entry point for building a simple solar tool. It also harkens back to ancient uses for solar energy, in a time when fuel for burning was  expensive. Perlin quotes [Giambattista della Porta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_della_Porta) who said:
"It is good husbandry, to rely on solar energy when ever possible, for the work is done without wood, or coals, or labor". Interestingly enough, della Porta also imagined a gigantic solar mirror for burning enemy ships (people are complicated).

My intended use for the still reflects the use in the picture, to create a perfume (which I will write a part 2 post for). From the same page, Perlin quotes Adam Lonicer who wrote in 1561 how this was done: "Certain types of flowers were submerged in a clear, water-filled vase, which was placed at the focal point of a spherical concave mirror. The concentrated solar heat caused the aromas of the flowers to diffuse into the water, and voilÃ , you had perfume".

The guide I followed and will be walking through with my experience, is this article on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-simple-solar-still/) from several years ago.

### Materials ðŸŒž

* 1 gallon plastic/glass jar. I used this [plastic jar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WWBR13B/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), but if I started today would use this [glass one](https://www.amazon.com/Empty-Gallon-Airtight-Leakproof-Plastic/dp/B075JR6H11/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1548533524&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=1+gallon+glass+jar&psc=1) instead since I'm trying to use less plastic. Both lids are plastic for cutting a circular hole in the top, I'd be interested to see a solution that avoids plastic though ðŸ¤”

* 1 "mash" insulating jar. I used this [growler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GUIMD9Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* 1 glass collector. I used a beer bottle, other small bottles with a cork sized mouth would work too.

* 3/8" copper coil cut into 24" - 32" length. I found this at my local [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3-8-in-OD-x-10-ft-Copper-Soft-Refrigeration-Coil-3-8-R-10RE/203654362?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal2_rr-_-202287075-_-203654362-_-N)

* 3 square foot mirrors. I found mine at a local hardware store

* Wood/cardboard backing for the mirrors + duct tape or other adhesive for mounting

* 2 corks. I used corks from two wine bottles that I had to drill holes through, though the instructable's article mentions finding corks with holes at a wine-brewer hobby shop (could not find one in NYC). I think these could be an equivalent found [online](https://www.widgetco.com/7-cork-stoppers-cork-extra-drilled-hole-3-8-inch), but I did not go that route
