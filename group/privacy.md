## Privacy Policy

Using the app requires an email and password to sign in with.

I rely on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to handle authentication as well as store user information.

The information you store is not discoverable in any way by other users of the app. 

### Information Collected

- Your email address you use to sign up with
- Groups and people you create are stored in a Firebase database in plaintext

### Contacting Me

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email me at kevinjohnsonutx@gmail.com
