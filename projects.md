# Apps

## [TODOs ‚ôªÔ∏è](https://github.com/longhorn499/TODOs)

A daily TODOs App I made for myself to replace the notebooks I was fillling over the years. It combines weekly planning with custom to-do lists which I was previously writing and crossing out constantly. I took a lot of inspiration from Trello which I think is great and useable in many different contexts.  Not in the App Store, just useful for myself.

## Go - Play With Friends üéç

This is my only current App in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/go-play-with-friends/id1472121646) and it's also [open source](https://github.com/longhorn499/Go-iOS). Inspired by other apps that were built in the open and hoping to learn from future contributors.

## Paintball BST üé®üèÄ

A marketplace project I worked on from 2017-2018. I wrote it about it on my [website](/2018/11/11/sunsetting-iOS-side-project.html). I was the sole developer and wrote the iOS app and backend code before migrating to Firebase.

## [Waveman](https://github.com/longhorn499/Waveman)

A sprite game where I drew and made pixel art (thanks to this [tutorial](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial) - written by the creator of the famous game Spelunky!). Written in 2015 in Objective-C.

## [CARAssetsAnalyzer](https://github.com/longhorn499/CARAssetsAnalyzer)

Analyze your app's assets in an app‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. With sizing information and visualization for what images would look like unconstrained. The goal was to use this to find unused and improperly sized images in a project I was working on.

## [ActivityNavigationItem](https://github.com/longhorn499/ActivityNavigationItem)

Handles the common design on iOS of animating `UIActivityIndicatorView` in place of a `UIBarButtonItem` that triggered an action. Installable via CocoaPods.

## [ImageAlertPresenter](https://github.com/longhorn499/ImageAlertPresenter)

Inspired by the AirDrop alert on iOS. Present `UIAlertController` with a configurable image.

## [SpotifySwiftFuture](https://github.com/longhorn499/SpotifySwiftFuture)

Example project for implementing Spotify's iOS SDK - that only plays music by Future.
