# Apps

## Go - Play With Friends üéç

An ancient Chinese board game. This is my only current [active app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/go-play-with-friends/id1472121646) and it's also [open source](https://github.om/longhorn499/Go-iOS). Inspired by other apps that were built in the open and hoping to learn from future contributors.

## Paintball BST üé®üèÄ

A marketplace project I worked on from 2017-2018. I wrote it about it on my site [here](http://localhost:4000/2018/11/11/sunsetting-iOS-side-project.html). I was the sole developer and wrote the iOS app and backend code before migrating to Firebase.


## Waveman

A sprite game where I drew and made pixel art (shoutout to this [tutorial](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial)). Written in 2015 in Objective-C, lives [here](https://github.com/longhorn499/Waveman).

# Open Source

All of these projects can be viewed on my GitHub [profile](https://github.com/longhorn499).

## DoomFireSwift üî•

Recreated the fire effect from this amazing [article](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html) on iOS using `UIKit` running at 60 fps üòé.

## CARAssetsAnalyzer

Analyze your app's assets in an app. With sizing information and visualization for what images would look like unconstrained. The goal was to use this to find unused and improperly sized images.

## ActivityNavigationItem

Handles the common design on iOS of animating `UIActivityIndicatorView` in place of a `UIBarButtonItem` that triggered an async action.

## UImageAlertPresenter

Inspired by the AirDrop alert on iOS. Present `UIAlertController` with a configurable image.

## SpotifySwiftFuture

Example project for implementing Spotify's iOS SDK - that only plays music by Future.
