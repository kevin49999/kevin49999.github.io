## Paintball BST

A marketplace project I worked on from 2017-2018. I wrote a [blog post](/2018/11/11/sunsetting-iOS-side-project.html) about the experience. I was the sole developer, wrote the iOS app, backend code (before migrating to Firebase), and ran the social media.

## Waveman

A sprite game where I drew and made pixel art (thanks to this [tutorial](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial) written by the creator of the famous game Spelunky). Written in 2015 in Objective-C.
