# Apps

## TODOs

A daily TODOs app I made to replace the notebooks I was filling over the years. It combines weekly planning with custom to-do lists which I was previously writing and crossing out constantly.

[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-todos/id1543653290)

## Go - Play With Friends

This is my only current app in the App Store (and it's open source).

## Paintball BST

A marketplace project I worked on from 2017-2018. I wrote a [blog post](/2018/11/11/sunsetting-iOS-side-project.html) about the experience. I was the sole developer, wrote the iOS app, backend code (before migrating to Firebase), and ran the social media.

## Waveman

A sprite game where I drew and made pixel art (thanks to this [tutorial](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial) written by the creator of the famous game Spelunky). Written in 2015 in Objective-C.

# Misc.

These assorted projects/ideas and more can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/longhorn499).

## DoomFireSwift/FizzleFade

I recreated old-school id Software game effects for iOS using Fabien Sanglard's [great blog](https://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html) as the reference.

## CARAssetsAnalyzer

Analyze your app's assets in an app. Displays sizing information and displays what images would look like unconstrained. The goal was to use this to find unused and improperly sized images in a project I was working on at the time.

## ActivityNavigationItem

Animates loading after tapping a navigation item button on iOS. Install with SPM or CocoaPods.

## ImageAlertPresenter

Inspired by the AirDrop alert on iOS. Present `UIAlertController` with a configurable image.

## SpotifySwiftFuture

Example project for implementing Spotify's iOS SDK that only plays music by Future.
