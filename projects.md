# Apps

## TODOs ‚ôªÔ∏è

A daily [TODOs](https://github.com/longhorn499/TODOs) App I made for myself to replace the notebooks I was fillling over the years. It combines weekly planning with custom to-do lists which I was previously writing and crossing out constantly. I took a lot of inspiration from Trello which I think is great and useable in many different contexts.  Not in the App Store, just using myself right now. 

## Go - Play With Friends üéç

The ancient Chinese board game. This is my only current App in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/go-play-with-friends/id1472121646) and it's also [open source](https://github.com/longhorn499/Go-iOS). Inspired by other apps that were built in the open and hoping to learn from future contributors.

## Paintball BST üé®üèÄ

A marketplace project I worked on from 2017-2018. I wrote it about it on my site [here](/2018/11/11/sunsetting-iOS-side-project.html). I was the sole developer and wrote the iOS app and backend code before migrating to Firebase.

## Waveman

A sprite game where I drew and made pixel art (thanks to this [tutorial](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial) - written by the creator of the famous game Spelunky!). Written in 2015 in Objective-C, lives [here](https://github.com/longhorn499/Waveman).

## CARAssetsAnalyzer

Analyze your app's assets in an app. With sizing information and visualization for what images would look like unconstrained. The goal was to use this to find unused and improperly sized images.

## ActivityNavigationItem

Handles the common design on iOS of animating `UIActivityIndicatorView` in place of a `UIBarButtonItem` that triggered an action.

## UImageAlertPresenter

Inspired by the AirDrop alert on iOS. Present `UIAlertController` with a configurable image.

Example project for implementing Spotify's iOS SDK - that only plays music by Future.
