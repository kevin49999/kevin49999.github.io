# Apps

## TODOs

A daily TODOs App I made for myself to replace the notebooks I was filling over the years. It combines weekly planning with custom to-do lists which I was previously writing and crossing out constantly. I took a lot of inspiration from Trello which I think is great and useable in many different contexts.  Not in the App Store, just useful for myself.

## Go - Play With Friends

This is my only current App in the App Store and it's also open source. Inspired by other apps that were built in the open and hoping to learn from future contributors.

## Paintball BST

A marketplace project I worked on from 2017-2018. I wrote it about it on my [website](/2018/11/11/sunsetting-iOS-side-project.html). I was the sole developer and wrote the iOS app and backend code before migrating to Firebase.


## Waveman

A sprite game where I drew and made pixel art (thanks to this [tutorial](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial) - written by the creator of the famous game Spelunky). Written in 2015 in Objective-C.
